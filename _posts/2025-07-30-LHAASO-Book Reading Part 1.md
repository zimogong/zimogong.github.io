Recently, I've been reading an intriguing and interesting book called ***拉索LHAASO*** , and I am deeply fascinated by the contents in the book. I also strongly recommend it to anyone who's interested in cosmic physics and astronomy. It mainly introduced the general information of LHAASO, the history and evolution of cosmic ray detection in China, LHAASO's accomplishments, and the process of building LHAASO. I've just completed the first half of the book, so the notes presented below are only the first part. Anyway, here it is:

# LHAASO:  The Gamma Sentinel of the Universe Part 1

## General Information

**LHAASO**(Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) is a gigantic scientific facility constructed to observe the high energy gamma rays from the cosmos in order to provide valuable information about the origin of cosmic rays. This colossal "watcher" lays in 四川，海子山 at an altitude of **4410 meters**(About **14,500 feet**.), covering 1.36 square kilometer of land(About the size of 190 standard soccer field). It took about 5 years to complete this huge facility.

## Accomplishment of LHAASO

Since 2021, LHAASO has continued to make significant contribution to the gamma astronomy.  

### 1. Detected the most energetic gamma photon ever observed by human.

17th, May, 2021, LHAASO received an gamma photon that possessed an energy of 1.4PeV(1P=10^15), which was the most energetic photon humanity had ever observed. The gamma photon contained about 205 times more energy than the most energetic particle ever produced by LHC. It was proposed that the gamma photon originate from the star-formation area of Cygnus.

### 2. Completely recorded the process of the brightest GRB(Gamma-ray Burst) ever--BOAT.

On 9th, October, 2022, LHAASO observed the whole proess of a GRB from a gigantic star's sudden collapse 2 billion years ago. The burst produced tons of high energy photons that can achieve 1 TeV, and after traveling through the cosmos for 2.4 billion years, they struck the LHAASO's electromagnetic particle detectors in Sichuan. The luminance of the GRB was so intense that it was 50 times brighter than the second brightest GRB ever detected. This finding can greatly help scientists gain deeper insight into the jet structure of GRB and its evolution mechanism.
