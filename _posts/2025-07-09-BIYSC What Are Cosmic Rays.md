Today, we started our project of BIYSC(**Cosmic rays’ detection: astrophysics at your fingertips**) in Barcelona. We met with our instructors and visited our lab for the first time, in which we would work for about 10 days. Although it was not the large one that I was expecting, the lab still have enough space support almost all our activities. There were some really cool equipments like the huge laser cutter, and the instructors said that we would have the chance to manipulate them. 

After a brief introduction to the lab and the people working there, we commenced our project by having our mentor, Juan Jiménez, giving us a short speech about the upcoming activities in the next few days.  We then listened to another instructor's lecture about the properties of muon and the significance of the muon detectors, which was intriguing and exciting. Finally, after learning the basic background knowledge, we designed the box for our detector like where to put the reflective foil and the plastic scintillators so that the silicon multiplier could receive the signals most efficiently.

Here are some notes about cosmic rays: 

## What Are Cosmic Rays

Cosmic rays are showers of particles that were formed by the interaction between particles from the cosmos(Usually supernovae and black-holes) and the molecules in the atmosphere. These particles usually travel around the speed of light(So special relativity should be considered), and their number striking the surface of the Earth is gigantic. One kind of particle that reach us is called muon(A graph of how muon particles are produced by a proton is shown below). Muon is one of the elementary particle(One of fermions) that have the same charge as electrons but about 207 times its mass, so it will go through most materials without interact with nucleus in the material.  Thus, these properties endow muon particles exceptional ability to penetrate matters, and we can utilize this to block the impact of signals that come from other particles when constructing a muon detector.
