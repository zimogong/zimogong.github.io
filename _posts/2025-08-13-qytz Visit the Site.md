# What is \"The Thousand-Eyed Dzi\"

The Thousand-Eyed Dzi, officially named **Circular Array Solar Radio Imaging Telescope (CSRT)**, is a circular array of telescopes located on a plateau in Daocheng County. It is designed to **monitor solar eruptions in real time**—such as flares and coronal mass ejections—to help forecast space weather and protect communication, navigation, and space systems. It is also one of the world largest array created to observe the activities of the sun.

Here's some of the pictures I took at the site.(The gradeur of the view was indescribable)
