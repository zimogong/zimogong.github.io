Hey there fellas, it has been a while since I returned from my project in BIYSC, Barcelona, and I have been trying to replicate the muon detector we built in the lab based on my notes, my memories, and the model I brought back(Courtesy to Ryan, Aitor, and Paul who endow me the opportunity to continue my project back in Chongqing). 

However, things didn't go quite well since I lack critical information about the detector. Because I was only allowed to take the box part of the detector, I do not know how the amplifier works, so I have to ask the staff in IFAE(Institut de FÃ­sica d'Altes Energies) for help on the circuit of the amplifier. I also tried to figure out the circuit under the assist of some professional electric engineers. That is, we tried to guess the circuit based on the picture I took, but it was in vain because we could not infer the whole amplifier's structure with just one pic. Thus, I have to wait for the reply from Barcelona.

Anyway, during the waiting period, some other tasks can be completed such as 3D printing the light-blocking box and purchasing the SiPMs. I've already got the box ready and the SiPMs in hand, but I still have to wait for some days before I can truly start working on my own detector. In the mean time, I think I will work on something else for a bit.
