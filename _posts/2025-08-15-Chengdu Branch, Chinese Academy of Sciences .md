# Visiting TIANFU Cosmic Ray Research Center

Today is one of the most meaningful and important day in my journey. On our way back to Chongqing, we returned to Chengdu and visited the TIANFU Cosmic Ray Research Center, which is affiliated to High Energy Department of Chengdu Branch, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Although I only stayed there for one hour, I had learned a whole lot about all kinds of detectors.

  When we stepped into the front door of the building, all kinds of apparatus equipping LHAASO came into view: The PM, SiPM, WFCTA, LACT, and so on. A few minutes later, Zhang, the expert we were conducting with walked out from the corridor and greeted us. Then he showed us around the exhibitions in the main hall of the department and introduced the apparatus to us. After a while, another expert, who is a Doctor,  showed up. Zhang told us he is working on the LACT project and have expertise in cosmic ray detectors.

Doctor Sun, later examined the muon detectors we built in BIYSC and approved its quality, saying that the working principles of the detector is similar to the actual professional muon detectors they built. However, he then provided me with some valuable advices on how the improve the resolving power and the shielding effectiveness of the detector.

Also, the experts gave me some instructions on how to popularize the science related to cosmic rays Here are some of them:

1. Adding lead sheets on the top and at the bottom of the box to block the disturbing signals of other particles.

2. Use multiple layers of plastic scintillators like those in some of the satellites to identify the incident angle and the trajectory of the particle.

3. Apply a electric or magnetic field to the detector and see how the trajectory of the particles vary.

4. Exhibit the cloud chamber experiment to visualize the cosmic ray particles and to attract the interest of the audience when giving lectures on the cosmic ray.

5. Build a more advanced muon telescope and place it on the roof of a building to record the data.

6. Add an electronic counter to the whole detector to keep the track of the number of photons absorbed by the PM and calculate the amount of signal a single photon produces.

   Finally, before we left, expert Zhang leaded us into the laboratory where the photomultipliers of the HUNT project are manufactured. He said that HUNT requires 50 thousands of those photomultipliers, which takes up a volume of 30 cubic kilometers. Thus, the two ideal locations to place them are Lake Baikel and the Southern Sea of China.
