Alright, after working on the cosmic ray project of BIYSC for a week, it's time for some fun things! Yesterday, we went on a science trip to the CosmoCaixa Barcelona museum, and it really widened my horizon. There were tons of fantastic exhibitions and items such as the Foucault pendulum, the evolution of the universe, and the internal rain-forest ecosystem of the museum.

Among all the exhibitions, I think the ecosystem was the most magnificent because it was truly amazing to examine a rain-forest system so closely in an artificial museum. There were also loads of odd and grotesque creatures that look as if they came from the Mesozoic Era. Take a look at this monster(**Arapaima** — one of the largest freshwater fish species in the world.):

Not only animals, the planetary lives there are equally mesmerizing. With the gigantic trees climbing toward to the top of the building and tropical birds strutting among the ground plants, you can almost feel like you have traveled from Europe to Amazon in less than a second when entering the area from outside.

Apart from the ecosystem, other exhibitions were fascinating as well. For instance, one of them demonstrated how the phenomenon of persistence of vision occur by accelerate the spin of a plate, on which a series of statue of characters from the Toy Story stood. When the plate acquire a certain angular speed, the original static figure seemed to be moving as if you were watching a film.

When you step into the museum, the first thing you will notice is the giant Foucault pendulum that stretch from the ground floor to the top floor which is about 20 meters or so. According to the physics, the pendulum will keep swinging automatically due to the Earth's spin. What makes it special was there were a circle of cylindrical pillars that experience unstable equilibrium that will fall if the pin at the bottom of the pendulum's metal sphere collide with it with sufficient force. However, the pendulum has to take a LONG time to swing to an appropriate angle to encounter the pillar, so you have to watch patiently to witness this.

Overall, it was really a satisfying and eye-opening tour, and I would call it an amazing day if the trip to the Sagrada Familia wasn't canceled because of the flood warning. I deeply regret that I missed two opportunities to visit that magnificent building ('Cause some of my friends sneaked out of the residence to visit there and I didn't join them :(.​ )
