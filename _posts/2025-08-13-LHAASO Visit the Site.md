# Inside LHAASO

Finally, after a 50-minute car ride from Daocheng, I arrived at the actual site of LHAASO to explore its inner mysteries. The weather was not on our side today because the air was frigid, and it rained slightly from time to time. However, it didn't impede my exploration. After we parked the car in front of the gate, a young Tibetan maintainer greeted us and opened the gate. Although all the scientists were absent today, according to the employee, I was still excited to see what was inside. Then, he hopped inside a mini car(The one that can be used exclusively inside LHAASO) and told us to drive after him, and the journey began. 

First, we came to the very center of the whole LHAASO array, where the huge board with the name of LHAASO stood. On top of the board was a platform for a lookout. The view there was similar to the platform outside LHAASO, but it was more detailed and closer to the apparatus. Thus, I was again shocked by the magnificence of the detector arrays when looking down the platform.

After taking some pictures on the platform, we moved on to the Water Cherenkov Detector area. To my disappointment, although the three large detectors filled with tons of water lie right next to me, without the presence of the scientists and maintainers, we can not enter the building and row the boat on the water like they did in the book. Thus, we can only move our eyes to the WFCTA array that was planted beside WCDA. The telescopes seem tiny when I observe the photos in the book, but they were truly gigantic when I examine them underneath.

Apart from the two mentioned above were the muon detector array and electromagnetic particle detector array, which we saw along the tour inside LHAASO. There was nothing special about their appearance. The muon detectors were just lumps of earth covered with some vegetation, and the electromagnetic particle detectors were shaped like ordinary rectangular boxes, a conspicuous contrast to their complex structures inside. If there was indeed something noticeable, I would say it was the electromagnetic particle detector array that floats on the lake. Also, the muon detectors' size was way more colossal and impressive than the one we built in Barcelona(Well, part of the reason is that the way the two kinds of muon detectors work and their accuracy differs.)

Our journey ended when we passed by the LHAASO lake. I might have said goodbye to LHAASO, but my heart and memories will stay.
