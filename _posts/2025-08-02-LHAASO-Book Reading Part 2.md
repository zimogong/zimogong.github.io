Today, I finally finished reading ***LHAASO***, and I really appreciate the book because the knowledge it provides benefits me a lot. Here is the follow up for the notes of Part 1:

# LHAASO: The Gamma Sentinel of the Universe Part 2

## Main Components of LHAASO

LHAASO was mainly comprised of four parts: The "Iron Boxes", the "Water Cans", the "Great Pools", and the "Blue Canisters". Each of the nickname correspond to a specific kind of detector. 

### 1. The Iron Boxes

The Iron Boxes refers to the electromagnetic particle detectors. As its nickname depicts, the detectors looks like arrays of metal boxes spotted on the ground when looking from above. It is quite a view since the total number of the detectors achieve 5216. They can clearly identify particles that play a role in the electromagnetic interactions such as electrons, positrons, and **gamma photons**. Their main components are **photomultipliers**, **wavelength-shifted optical fiber**,  small-sized, light-sensitive detector, and so on.

### 2. The  Water  Cans

The Water Cans refers to the 1188 muon detectors planted among the Iron Boxes. The whole apparatus looks like a small earth hill since it requires about 2.5 meters of soil to block the electrons and photons so that the detector will not receive superfluous signals(As you may remember from some of my previous blogs if you have read them). Beneath the soil is a water can that contain tons of non-conducting, ultra-clean water. When the muons enter the water, they produce **Cherenkov radiation** which produce a faint blue light to be seen by the detectors at the bottom. 

### 3.The Great Pools

The Great Pools indicates the three colossal **WCDA**(Water Cherenkov Detector Array) in the middle of LHAASO. There are three in total. Two of them have a dimension of 150 meters x 150 meters while the remaining one has 300 meters x 110 meters. They were designed to detect VHE photons through means similar to the muon detectors. Inside them are **350 THOUSAND tons** of pure water utilized as a detecting medium, so the staff working inside have to row a boat to check their components. The pools are divided into 3120 5 meters x 5 meters units, and each one contains a 20000 rmb silicon photomultiplier. The sensitivity of the three WCDA is three times greater than the HAWC(An experiment conducted by US and Mexico).

### 4. The Blue Canisters

The Blue Canisters is a nickname for the **WFCTA** (Wide-Field-of-view Cherenkov Telescope Array ). The 18 telescopes stand in the center of LHAASO, and they only operate at night to detect the atmospheric Cherenkov radiation because the intense sunlight during the day will scorch their "eyes". However, the WFCTA is a great improvement compared to those previous Cherenkov telescopes that can only look into the universe during moonless nights. Thanks to the **SiPM** in front of the telescope, the intensity of light can be vastly diminished, allowing the telescopes to speculate the cosmos even with the presence of the moon.
