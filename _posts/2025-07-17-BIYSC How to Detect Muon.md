17th, July was our last day in the lab, so we had to say goodbye with our instructors in UAB(The university where our lab is), which was kinda sad since we had been working and sometimes playing (a game called ninja) with them for the past 2 weeks. We all enjoyed the precious time with each other. Anyway, for our project, we had been testing our muon detector in the past few days in order to get our presentation's power point done. After acquiring all the data we need and analyzed it with Python, we have a complete version of the power point we will use on the presentation day. Thus, we could(and also must) practice to present our project for several times and provide feedback to the speakers so that they could deliver their message more confidently and better on the following day. 

As usual, here is some detailed information about what we were doing:

## The Testing Result of Our Detectors

We designed 3 experiment associated with the detector to search for factors that effect the flux of muon detected. Here they are:

### 1. Does the time of the day affect the flux?

We spent three days to measure the flux of muon particles (inside the lab) at different time of a day. Each measurement lasted for 20 minutes, and we calculated the mean flux by dividing the total number of muons identified by the time and the area of the SiPM. Here is a graph of our result: ![data-time](data_time.png)

### 2. Does the environment affect the rate of muon detections?

We hypothesized that the concrete structure of the building may decline the number of muons reaching the detector, so we moved our detectors outside and repeat the measures we made inside the lab. The result was not very reliable since we only took one 20-minutes experiment outside, but here is a diagram for the comparison anyway: ![data-environment](data_environment.png)

### 3. Does the angle of the detector with respect to the horizontal affect the measurement?

Finally, for our last test, we attempted to find the relationship between the angle that our detectors make with the horizontal and the flux of muons, and we discovered that there was a a negative correlation between the muon flux and the angle from horizontal. Hence, the result showed that there were more abundance of muons directly above the detector. ![data-angle](data_angle.png)
